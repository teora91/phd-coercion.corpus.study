Compared to existing widely used toolkits, Sta n z a features a language-agnostic fully neural pipeline for text analysis, including tokenization, multiword token expansion, lemmatization, part-ofspeech and morphological feature tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition. We have trained Sta n z a on a total of 112 datasets, including the Universal Dependencies treebanks and other multilingual corpora, and show that the same neural architecture generalizes well and achieves competitive performance on all languages tested. Additionally, Sta n z a includes a native Python interface to the widely used Java Stanford CoreNLP software, which further extends its functionality to cover other tasks such as coreference resolution and relation extraction. Source code, documentation, and pretrained models for 66 languages are available at https:// stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/.},

	abstract = {Norwegian has been one of many languages lacking sufficient available text to train quality language models. In an attempt to bridge this gap, we introduce the Norwegian Colossal Corpus (NCC), which comprises 49GB of clean Norwegian textual data containing over 7B words. The NCC is composed of different and varied sources, ranging from books and newspapers to government documents and public reports, showcasing the various uses of the Norwegian language in society. The corpus contains mainly Norwegian Bokmål and Norwegian Nynorsk. Each document in the corpus is tagged with metadata that enables the creation of sub-corpora for specific needs. Its structure makes it easy to combine with large web archives that for licensing reasons could not be distributed together with the NCC. By releasing this corpus openly to the public, we hope to foster the creation of both better Norwegian language models and multilingual language models with support for Norwegian.},

	abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to present two of the speech corpora developed at the Text Laboratory of the Department of Linguistics and Scandinavian Studies at the University of Oslo, which are available on the web. These two corpora, NoTa-Oslo and TAUS, consist of spontaneous speech from residents of Oslo, NoTa-Oslo speech recorded in 2005–2006 and TAUS speech recorded in 1972–1973. The web search interface is relatively simple to use, and the transcriptions are linked to audio files (for both NoTa-Oslo and TAUS) and video files (for NoTa-Oslo). NoTa-Oslo and TAUS are both multi-purpose corpora, designed to serve several research tasks in different fields, such as phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, dialogue, dialectology, sociolinguistics, lexicography, and language technology. This makes the corpora very useful for most purposes, but it also means that they cannot immediately meet the demands of every research task. The authors present the two corpora, their content and their web interface, and then discuss how they can be used for phonological research.},
